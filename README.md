StreamViewer
============

Desktop stream viewer for linux, using python, webkit and gtk

I wrote this program for a project in college about a year ago. 

To run it, open a terminal in the program directory and execute python version0-5

It uses webkit to display live video streams from twitch.tv and justin.tv, and gtk for the GUI(which isn't 
anything too special!)

You can open as many concurrent streams as your computer can handle(i got to 5 on a netbook, streams on 480p, before
they started lagging. I've had 15+ open on my pc, 720p and no lag)

You can also add streamers to a favourites list. you'll get a notification if any of your favourites come online.
