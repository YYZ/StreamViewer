#TODO for Dual Craft V0.4

2. YouTube module.
4. Search by game.
5. Search YouTube.
6. Check if stream online.
7. Add favourites.
8. Check status of favourites.
9. Notification for when a favourite comes online.

This version brings a pretty much fully functional search function! Still no YouTube module, but I'll get going on that soon. Hoping to have some sort of 
display sorted for showing what streams are online by the start of next week.
